# Intro

I am a Full-Stack Web Developer learning new languages and technologies everyday.  I currently work as a Software Developer for GalaxE.Solutions using various code language, libraries, and testing suites. My engineering and architecture roots give me a keen eye for details and creative problem solving skills.

# Currently

Since gradutating I am expanding my knowledge within front end and backend languages such as React, AWS, C#, Java, and Python.

# Some history

My background in the tech world started when I ventured into Mechanical Engineering as my major out of high school. Prior to immersing myself into engineering I had aspirations for a career in architecture or cardiology. What I found all three fields have in common was understanding how things work to find innovative and creative ways to fix them. As I researched more as a developer I have found that this field captivates all those things I am passionate about. Being able to build a project with a group, understanding its ins and outs, solving bugs that will occur, and presenting the best work I know myself and my team are capable are all aspects of development I always strive to achieve.
